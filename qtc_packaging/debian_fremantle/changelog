  * Given the above, the manual panel group selector has been removed.
  * The favorites dialog button has been removed from the main screen, and a link to it has been added to the menu.  To make room, the device browser has been removed (for now).  (This is a temporary measure; a new keyset admin panel is in the works, which should simplify things.)
  * The flickable tab bar can now be displayed at the top or bottom of the screen (controllable from the preferences panel).
