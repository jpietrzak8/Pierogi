pierogi (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New window added for selecting keysets by device. "Device" filter removed from select keyset by name window.

  * With the hope of extending the N900's range a bit, I'm setting all protocols to use a duty cycle of 50%, regardless of what the documentation says they should use.  I hope this won't cause any problems.
  * New versioning scheme -- new version name comes at the start of new work, rather than at the end. :)  Pierogi 1.1 is labeled "For a Few Pierogis More".
