Universal Infrared Remote Control App

This is an app that provides an interface for a variety of devices
controllable via infrared.  At the moment, it only supports the Nokia N900.

The main features of this app are:

 * A self-contained database of IR codes, drawn from the collections of the
LIRC project, the hifi-remotes.com website, and the remotecentral.com website.
 * Independence from the LIRC server -- LIRC is designed mainly for receiving
IR commands, where Pierogi is focussed on sending them.
 * A "universal" interface, intended to be usable across a wide variety of
devices.
 * The ability to remember your favorite devices.
