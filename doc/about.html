Note: while this app is in a fairly usable state, the keysets are still
incomplete and mostly untested.  Many brands of device are not yet supported,
and those which have keysets may only work in a limited manner.  Please do
post on the
<a href="https://garage.maemo.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=7316">Pierogi Forum Board</a>
if you find bugs to fix, have suggestions on future enhancements, or have
particular devices or brands you would like to see added to the list of
keysets.  Thank you!
