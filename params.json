At the moment, it only supports the Nokia N900.\r\n\r\nThe main features of this app are:\r\n\r\n * A self-contained database of IR codes, drawn from the collections of the\r\nLIRC project, the hifi-remotes.com website, and the remotecentral.com website.\r\n * Independence from the LIRC server -- LIRC is designed mainly for receiving\r\nIR commands, where Pierogi is focussed on sending them.\r\n * A \"universal\" interface, intended to be usable across a wide variety of\r\ndevices.\r\n * The ability to remember your favorite devices.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
